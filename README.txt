This is the source code for the Blue Valley server to push to the Journey platform. From the Blue Valley website, users will be redirected to this third party website to fill out customer information. This information will then be sent from this server to the Journey database for use on the mobile application. This project is written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C# using Visual Studio Express for Web on a Windows 8.1 VM.

User fills out the reservation form data, it is then converted to a JSON object, and then pushed to our Journey app instance for us on the mobile application.

This project was developed by Braden Katzman.
